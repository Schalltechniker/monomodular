Some rudimentary information about Binary:

Binary is a 24 track sequencer built to unify some of the functions of polygome, boinngg, touchcafe, etc.  

The green buttons on the left are called row[1] - row[4];
on the bottom, they are called column[1] - column[8].

The basic idea:

The top 3 rows of dials represent the sequences.  You can select a sequence by pressing its dial, the led below it will light when its selected.

The bottom row of dials are parameters for the selected sequence. They reflect either the note# for the sequence step, or one of the 8 parameters in the plugin's window.

You can program a sequence by pressing the column buttons to turn on/off steps. 

You can change the speed of the sequence by turning its corresponding dial.

You can move the position of the sequence by pushing and turning the sequence.

You can synchronize the speed of one sequence to another by pressing and holding its dial, then pressing the dial of the sequence to synchronize it to.

The green led in the ledring represents the 'active' status of a sequence. If the green led isn't lit, it is not playing.  To activate a sequence, select it and press the row[2] button. 

The row[1] button is a shift button.  It will pause the display of the selected sequence so that it can be edited.  Also, if you press a dial while holding shift, it will toggle quantization for that sequence.

If you hold shift and press row[2], it will start flashing.  This means you are in 'play mode'.  In this mode, pressing a sequence dial activates it, releasing it deactivates it.


Obviously, this is incomplete.  Just trying to encapsulate the basic ideas....


The best way to get going:

Install plugin, place a sampler or something right after to play its output.

Press dial 1/1.
Press row[2]  (the green led should turn on for dial 1/1)
Press some column buttons (they should light up and start moving)

If the sequence doesn't start moving right away, push-and-turn the dial. It should start after that (a bug).
